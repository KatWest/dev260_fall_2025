# Assignment 5: Browser Navigation System - Implementation Notes

**Name:** Katherine West

## Dual-Stack Pattern Understanding

**How the dual-stack pattern works for browser navigation:**
The BackStack stack holds the prevous data, ready to be popped back out, and the ForwardStack stack holds any data that was the 'current' before data from BackStack is popped out.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
Aside from needing to go back and check some terminal commands, probably kicking myself into do this part of the assignment.

**How you solved it:**
I let this part of the assignment sit until I felt motivated enought to finish it. Also, Lofi Girl helps me get the right motivation going.

**Most confusing concept:**
Everything was very clear. I was not confused at any point (as far as I can remember)

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
BEGONE CURLY BRACES FOR CODE THAT'S ONLY A SINGLE LINE!! üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
I'm quite satisfied with my code.

## Testing Approach

**How you tested your implementation:**
Ran the code, followed the promts, added writelines to make sure that data was going where it was supposed to.

**Issues you discovered during testing:**
No major issues

## Stretch Features

[If you implemented any extra credit features, describe them here. If not, write "None implemented"]

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 5 hours?

**Breakdown:**

- Understanding the assignment: < 1 hr
- Implementing the 6 methods: 2 hr
- Testing and debugging: 1 hr
- Writing these notes: < 1 hr

**Most time-consuming part:** Coding, but it didn't feel like it. Probably psyching myself up to do this part of the assignment.
